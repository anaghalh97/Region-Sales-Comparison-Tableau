### Course-End Project 2

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on comparing sales performance between two regions using an interactive Tableau dashboard.  

The goal is to help upper management visualize regional performance, identify strengths and weaknesses, and support data-driven strategic improvements.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create a dynamic dashboard that enables comparison of key sales metrics between a **Primary Region** and a **Secondary Region**.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** Sample Superstore  
- Contains sales, customer, order, product, and regional data.

---

## 🛠 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Dataset Preparation
- Loaded the Sample Superstore dataset into Tableau  
- Used grouping and data organization techniques to prepare the dataset  

### 2️⃣ Hierarchy Creation
- Created a **Location Hierarchy** to enable region-based drill-down analysis  

### 3️⃣ Parameter Creation
- Created two parameters:
  - Primary Region  
  - Secondary Region  
- Added all available regions to both parameters  
- Built calculated fields to dynamically switch and compare regions  

### 4️⃣ Calculated Fields
- Created a calculated field named **First Order Date** to identify the earliest order date for each region  

### 5️⃣ Dashboard Creation
- Designed an interactive comparison dashboard  
- Structured and aligned worksheets for clarity and consistency  
- Ensured dynamic updates based on region selection

## 📊 Dashboard Metrics

The dashboard compares the following metrics for both regions:

- First Order Date  
- Total Sales  
- Average Sales per Order  
- Number of Customers  
- Number of Orders  
- Number of Products Sold

## 📈 Outcome

- Enables clear side-by-side regional comparison  
- Highlights high-performing and underperforming regions  
- Supports management in making informed strategic decisions  
- Provides interactive and user-friendly data exploration  

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Tableau  
- Sample Superstore Dataset
